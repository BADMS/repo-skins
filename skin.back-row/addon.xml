		<summary>Back Row skin by Sharpe and DJDafreund</summary>
		<description>Back Row is all about recapturing the magic of going to the cinema in your own home. The skin has been designed with this aim in mind but has taken on board many good ideas and suggestions from the XBMC community. Over the years it has become a polished theme that works very well for both SD and HD setups. So go grab some popcorn and fool around on the Back Row.</description>

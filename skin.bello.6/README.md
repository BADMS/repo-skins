### **About**
This is the 6th generation of Bello skin for Kodi.
<br>Bello 6 is aiming to maximize your Kodi entertainment experience with its NEW Unique, Clean and Elegant interface while providing users a highly customization level and lots of cool features!

<br>

### **Installation**
Bello 6 is available for download on Kodi's official repository. Please refer to [this page](http://wiki.kodi.tv/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Change_skins) for instructions.

### **Supported Add-ons**

### **F.A.Q.**
**Where is my mouse pointer ?**
<br>Mouse usage is not supported in Bello and will never be.
<br>Please disable it from Settings > System > Input Devices > Enable mouse and touch screen support.

**When installing, I get an error message saying "dependencies not met**
<br>The cause for this is always one or more of the [required add-ons](https://github.com/Nessus85100/Bello/new/master?readme=1#supported-add-ons) not being installed on your system, or you're using a different (outdated) version of one or more of these add-ons. Make sure your add-ons are all updated. In Kodi's add-on browser bring up the context menu and select "force refresh". Wait for the system to search for and install add-on updates. Try installing the skin again after this. If the problem still persists double check by opening the addon.xml file in the skin.refocus folder. In between the "requires" tags all the required add-ons are listed. Check whether all of the correct versions of these add-ons are installed. If you are completely sure you have the correct ones, post a [debug log](http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy) on the [forum](http://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=198). Do not open an issue on Github for this please.

**I only see unwatched status indicators. Is there an option to display watched status indicators as well?**
<br>No, there isn't and will never be. There is an indicator if the item is unwatched. If there is no indicator, the item is watched. I find this obvious and logical, and thus feel there is no added value in placing an indicator on files that have been watched. 

**Can i play games using Bello ?. Is there any support for this ?**
<br>No and will never be. Why ?... because Kodi is not a games console and as surprising as it sounds to some people...<br>i don't play games!

**Can you add the X or Y feature ?**
<br>Mostly...not. As much as i hope people will enjoy using Bello, development is also driven by my own preferences. Apart from that, i just have no motivation to add features i wouldn't ever use myself and most importantly, my free time these days is very limited and it's unlikely to find more time besides some bug fixing.

**Where i can find support for this ?**
<br>[Bello forum at Kodi.tv community.](http://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=198)
